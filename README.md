## Google Sheets Integration

This project supports saving form submissions to a Google Sheet using a Google Service Account.

### Setup

1. **Create a Google Service Account**  
   In the [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/), create a Service Account and generate a key in JSON format.

2. **Share your Google Sheet**  
   Create a Google Sheet and share it with your Service Account email (can edit).

3. **Configure Environment Variables**  
   Copy `.env.example` to `.env.local` and fill in the following values:

   - `GOOGLE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_EMAIL` â€“ from your service account JSON
   - `GOOGLE_PRIVATE_KEY` â€“ from your service account JSON (use double quotes and preserve `\n` newlines)
   - `GOOGLE_SHEETS_ID` â€“ found in the Google Sheet URL (between `/d/` and `/edit`)
   - `GOOGLE_SHEETS_TAB` â€“ (optional) tab name, defaults to `Sheet1`

4. **Deploy**  
   On Vercel or locally, ensure the above environment variables are set.

### Troubleshooting

- If you see errors about authentication or permissions, double-check the service account, private key, and that the Sheet is shared to the service account email.
- For local dev, restart the server after editing `.env.local`.
